# slots
This is a simple slot machine application. Users start with $100 and may bet $5, $10, $25, or $50. Users' bets are subtracted from their balance, and they win 5x their bet if they match 3 numbers. If their balance is less than an available bet, that bet option disappears. The game ends once the user reaches $0.
